# AngularToolkit
Toolkit for easily adding TailwindCSS and FontAwesome to your angular project automatically.

### Usage
1. Create an Angular project in a different directory before using the script
```txt
ng new <Project name>
```
2. Open a shell window within the directory of the script and execute following command
```txt
py main.py
```
3. After running the script provide the absolute path to the root of your Angular project
```txt
Root directory of Angular project (Full path): C:\<Angular project root dir>
```
<small>*It will take a couple of seconds to complete all tasks*</small>  

4. Wait for following response message
```txt
DONE!
```


Now you can edit and run your Angular project like you normally would with TailwindCSS and FontAwesome installed without all the hassle!
